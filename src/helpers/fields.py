    Enum for Snowplow fields of interest.
    Snowplow documentation of these fields can be found here: https://docs.snowplow.io/docs/understanding-your-pipeline/canonical-event/.

    This class also subclasses from str so that, e.g., Field.DERIVED_TSTAMP == "derived_tstamp",
    which means we can pass Field.DERIVED_TSTAMP into a pandas DataFrame directly without having
    to grab its string value (Field.DERIVED_TSTAMP.value) first. (See use case as well as caveats:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58608361/string-based-enum-in-python.)
